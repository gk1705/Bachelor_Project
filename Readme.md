# Surgical Handless VR Interface

## Summary

Introducing a hands-free VR augmented reality interface for surgeons, designed for minimally invasive surgery alignment.
This system features a voice-controlled CT image viewer and 3D organ models, with adjustable position and orientation.
Head tilts and snapping to planes enable precise manipulation, enhancing surgical precision and efficiency.

## Functions

* Provide a hands-free augmented reality interface for surgeons.
* Assist in aligning 3D objects over patients during minimally invasive surgery.
* Display computed tomography (CT) images with hands-free control.
* Enable voice-command navigation and control.
* Spawn 3D assets of organs and planes for alignment.
* Manipulate 3D objects' position and orientation using head tilts.
* Snap objects to planes for precise fixed-axis movement.
